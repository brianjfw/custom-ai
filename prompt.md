Mission: Continue building our premium SMB platform with intelligent task management and design excellence.
Immediate Actions Required:

ðŸ“š Project Context Refresh

Read ALL documentation in /docs/ directory to understand current product vision
Review tasks.yaml for current task status and dependencies
Analyze codebase structure using @/ to understand implementation state
Check git status for recent changes and commit history


ðŸŽ¯ Task Prioritization & Selection

Identify the highest priority incomplete task in tasks.yaml
If current task is in_progress, continue with that task
If current task is completed, select next task based on:

Critical priority (1) tasks first
Dependency requirements (check dependencies array)
Development phase alignment (foundation â†’ frontend â†’ backend â†’ AI â†’ deployment)




ðŸ§  Strategic Planning

Analyze selected task requirements against existing codebase
Identify potential blockers or dependencies
Plan implementation approach using task's cursor_hints
Estimate realistic completion timeline



Context Guidelines:

Technology Stack: Next.js 14+, HeroUI, Tailwind CSS, tRPC, Drizzle ORM, Clerk
Design System: Glassmorphism with soft lavender (#f4f3ff), warm cream (#faf9f7), translucent glass surfaces
Code Quality: TypeScript strict mode, no any types, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

Expected Output:

Current State Analysis: Brief summary of where we left off
Selected Task: Which task you're working on and why
Implementation Plan: Step-by-step approach for the selected task
Timeline Estimate: Realistic completion estimate
Next Steps: Immediate actions to begin implementation

Success Criteria:

âœ… Task status updated to in_progress in tasks.yaml
âœ… Clear understanding of current codebase state
âœ… Logical task selection based on priorities and dependencies
âœ… Actionable implementation plan ready for execution

ðŸ”„ Loop Status: ACTIVE - Execute continuously until complete vision is realized
