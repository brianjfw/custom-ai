## 📝 Conclusion

The testing infrastructure has been significantly improved with a solid foundation for future expansion. While the 80% coverage target was not reached in this iteration, we've established the framework and best practices necessary to achieve that goal in future sprints. The focus has been on quality, maintainability, and creating a testing culture that supports confident development and deployment.

**Next Priority**: Continue expanding test coverage with focus on server-side components and integration testing to reach the 80% coverage target.
