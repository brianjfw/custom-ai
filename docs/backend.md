  cross_border_restrictions: boolean;
}

  routeRequest(request: IncomingRequest): TargetRegion {
    const tenant = this.getTenantConfig(request.tenant_id);
    const userLocation = this.getUserLocation(request);
    
    // GDPR compliance - EU data must stay in EU
    if (this.isEUResident(userLocation) && tenant.regulatory_requirements.includes('GDPR')) {
      return this.selectEURegion(tenant.preferred_regions);
    }
    
    // CCPA compliance - California residents
    if (this.isCaliforniaResident(userLocation) && tenant.regulatory_requirements.includes('CCPA')) {
      return this.selectUSRegion(tenant.preferred_regions);
    }
    
    // Default to closest region with no restrictions
    return this.selectClosestRegion(userLocation, tenant.prohibited_regions);
  }
